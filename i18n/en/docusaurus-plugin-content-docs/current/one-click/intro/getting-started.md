## Before getting started

Before starting your integration, you must have valid credentials. Currently, the **PicPay 1-Click** solution is not available to all our merchants. Interested? Simply contact us at relacionamento-negocios@picpay.com expressing your interest.

## Testing your integration

Currently, PicPay does not provide a Sandbox environment. All testing will be conducted in the production environment and will not incur any costs for the developer/merchant. All payments made can be immediately refunded using our cancellation API or through the merchant panel.
