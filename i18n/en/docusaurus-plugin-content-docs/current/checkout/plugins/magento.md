## Introduction

In this guide, we will describe step-by-step how you can integrate PicPay into your e-commerce with Magento 1 or 2.

## Before getting started

Before starting your onboarding, you must have valid credentials. You can check how to obtain your credentials [in this article](/checkout/intro/getting-started#antes-de-come√ßar).
