## Introduction

In this guide, we will describe the step-by-step process for you to use PicPay within your e-commerce with VTEX.

## Before getting started

Before starting your onboarding, you must have valid credentials. You can check how to obtain your credentials [in this article](/checkout/intro/getting-started#antes-de-come√ßar).

## How to use

### Getting your integration keys

Your integration keys will be available within the [retail panel](https://lojista.picpay.com/ecommerce-token), in the integrations menu.

These keys must be copied and inserted into your VTEX configuration panel.

:::caution Attention
Every time new tokens are generated using the **Generate Tokens** button, old tokens will be invalidated.

:::warning Issues obtaining keys.
Due to an instability in our new merchant panel (https://painel-empresas.picpay.com/), we recommend obtaining VTEX integration keys through the old merchant panel(https://lojista.picpay.com/ecommerce-token).
