## About this guide
In this guide we will describe the step-by-step process for you to process payments with PicPay by our logged payment solution.

## before starting

Before processing online payments by our **PicPay 1-Click** solution, you must have a valid, non-expired access_token. You can check how to generate your tokens [in this article](/one-click/guides/oauth2-flow).

## How it works

### Authentication

In addition to the `access_token`, generated dynamically, the payment end-point also needs an `Api-Key` that will be informed with your `client_id` and `client_secret`.

:::caution About the Api-Key
The `Api-Key` must not be shared in any way and must be stored securely on their servers.
:::

### Generating a charge to the user's wallet

With a valid `access_token`, the process of generating a charge on the customer's wallet is extremely simple. The charge must be generated by the end-point `v1/payments/charge`, indicating the amount to be debited in the body of the request. In the example below, we are requesting the charge of BRL 3.00 to the user's wallet.

```bash

curl --location --request POST 'https://api.picpay.com/v1/payments/charge' \
--header 'Api-Key: {{api_key}}' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {access_token}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"value":3}'

```
Below is an example of a successful return. The `transaction_id` must be saved as it is the key for reversal processes.

```json
{
    "transaction_id": "246599282",
    "created_at": "2021-02-22 19:29:16"
}
```

#### What will be the origin of the funds?

The charge amount may be debited from the credit card, balance or both (balance + card). If the customer has the *Use balance* option enabled in the App, we will first consume the user's balance and later (if there is not enough balance), charge the card.

Example: I'm making a purchase of R$60, I have a balance of R$19 in my wallet. PicPay will consume R$19 and charge the registered card for R$41.

#### Error Messages

We do not report error codes on transaction returns. We only inform you if the transaction was approved or not.

```json
{
    "message":"Unauthorized transaction."
}
```
